 While learning Hindi, I've come across some English words I didn't know had roots in Hindi:
 - **जंगल**: jungle, same spelling/pronunciation
 - **लूट**: loot, same spelling/pronunciation
 - **ठग**: thug, comes from the Hindi word thag, aka swindler
 - **जगन्नाथ**: Juggernaut, comes from the Hindi word Jagannath, an avatar of Vishnu
 - **ख़ुशी**: Cushy, comes from the Hindi word Khushi, meaning happiness
 - **पाँच**: Punch (like the drink), comes from the Hindi word paanch, which is another drink, but also means 5 because the drink had 5 ingredients
