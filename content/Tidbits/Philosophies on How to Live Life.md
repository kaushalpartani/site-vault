- Pick a small set of things and start to do them well and with a routine. Multiple experts, in certain cases, are better than one generalist, but no number of generalists have the same domain knowledge as an expert.
- Create a flexible schedule and try to stick to it. There will be times where you won't be able to follow it (traveling, emergencies, etc.), but that shouldn't stop you from getting right back into the schedule as soon as you can.
- Focus on yourself and your own well-being. Be it work, friends, whatever, just make sure that you give yourself enough time and energy. By doing so, you'll find yourself being a better friend, more confident in your work, etc.
