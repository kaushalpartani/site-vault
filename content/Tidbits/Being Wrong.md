Being wrong happens way more than you'd like. Mostly seems like a negative and a stressor in the moment, but being wrong leads to growth. It's how you deal with being wrong that makes being wrong okay. Putting your ego aside to say sorry, admitting you're wrong, and/or showing regret kick starts the crucial process of reflection, forcing you to iteratively be better every time in the future.
