This "blog" runs off quartz, which is a great way to create a static site out of notes. I had the idea to link this with the git obsidian plugin.

I should **theoretically** be able to get this working on my laptop, phone, and iPad, which means I'll be able to keep my notes in sync, push and deploy from wherever I want to.

Hopefully it works ðŸ¤ž!

Update: first post from phone!!
