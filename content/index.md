Hello, and welcome to where I write.

Currently, I'm:
- Working on revamping data delivery systems, addressing customer problems through software development, and learning about data engineering over at [Kharon](https://www.kharon.com/)
- Trying to get accustomed to learning quickly and thoroughly. Here's a short list of things that fall under that category, subject to change:
	- Hindi
	- GoLang
	- Dart
	- Python frameworks and libraries
	- Contributing to open source
- Getting back into consistent gymming to gain muscle while paying special attention to my knees, which have given me problems for most of my life.
